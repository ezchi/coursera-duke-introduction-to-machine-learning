### Multi-layer Perceptron

Build a 2-layer MLP for MNIST digit classfication. Feel free to play around with the model architecture and see how the training time/performance changes, but to begin, try the following:

Image (784 dimensions) -> fully connected layer (500 hidden units)  -> nonlinearity (ReLU) -> fully connected layer (100 hidden units) -> nonlinearity (ReLU) -> fully connected (10 hidden units) -> softmax
